# Project: Catch me if you can!

About the Game
--------------

Your journey takes you across 4 scenarios. Your goal is to find something as quickly as you can and click on his image! After every finding you are given a score point.
Take note, though: Your “click” must be very precise. If you don’t land exactly on spot, it doesn’t recognize it as a right answer.
