# game-project: Catch me if you can!

About the Game
--------------

Your journey takes you across 4 scenarios. Your goal is to find something as quickly as you can and click on his image! 
After every finding you are given a score point.
Take note, though: Your “click” must be very precise. 
If you don’t land exactly on spot, it doesn’t recognize it as a right answer.

Your time is 3 minutes. You can do it !!

I hope you have fun and enjoy the ride! ;)
